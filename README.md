# Clothing-Store

Simple clothing store design. Project was designed with html, CSS, and Javascript. Main focus was to get the cart to work how you would expect. The cart is capable of adding items, removing items, and totaling items.

This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube Series showing how to create a fully functioning shopping cart that you can see on most eCommerce stores.
